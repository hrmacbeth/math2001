Index of Lean tactics
=====================

Tactics marked \* are specific to this book, so you will not be able to get help with them by
googling/consulting internet forums/etc.  Reread the indicated part of the book or ask
your instructor!

.. rubric:: \* ``addarith`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <shortcut>`)

Attempts to solve an equality or inequality by moving terms from the left-hand side to the
right-hand side, or vice versa.

.. rubric:: ``apply`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <lemmas>`; for :math:`\forall` and :math:`\to` hypotheses, :numref:`Section %s <forall_implies>`)

Invokes a specified lemma or hypothesis to modify the goal.

.. rubric:: ``by_cases`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <lem>`)

Case-splits on whether a given statement is true or false.

.. rubric:: \* ``cancel`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <tactic_mode>`)
    
Cancels a common factor from LHS/RHS of equality/inequality, cancels an exponentiation common to both sides, etc.

.. rubric:: ``constructor`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <and>`; for ``↔`` goals: :numref:`Section %s <iff>`)

Splits an "and" goal (:math:`\land`) into sub-goals for its left and right parts.

.. rubric:: ``contradiction`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <contradiction_hyp>`)

If there are two contradictory hypotheses available, this concludes the proof.

.. rubric:: ``dsimp`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <parity>`)

Unfolds a definition.  Typically used while working on a proof rather than in the final version; it
is useful for inspecting a goal or hypothesis more carefully, but in most cases the proof will still
work after a ``dsimp`` line is deleted.

.. rubric:: \* ``extra`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <proving_inequalities>`; for congruences: :numref:`Section %s <using_modular>`)

A comparison tactic for inequalities, or other relations such as congruences: checks an inequality
whose two sides differ by the addition of a positive quantity, a congruence mod 3 whose two sides
differ by a multiple of 3, etc.

.. rubric:: ``interval_cases`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <forall_implies>`)

Given a natural-number or integer variable :math:`n` for which numeric upper and lower bounds are
available, produce cases for each of the numeric possibilities for :math:`n`.

.. rubric:: ``intro`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <forall_implies>`; for :math:`\lnot` goals: :numref:`Section %s <contradiction>`)

Introduces a universally quantified variable (:math:`\forall`) or the antecedent of an implication
(:math:`\to`) from the goal, or assumes (for the sake of contradiction) the positive version of a
negation (:math:`\lnot`) goal.

.. rubric:: ``left`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <or>`)

Selects the left alternative of an "or" goal (:math:`\lor`).

.. rubric:: ``have`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <tactic_mode>`; with a lemma: :numref:`Section %s <or>`; introducing a new goal: :numref:`Section %s <and>`)

Records a fact (followed by the proof of that fact), which then becomes available as an
extra hypothesis.

.. rubric:: ``mod_cases`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <using_modular>`)

Introduces cases for a variable according to its residue modulo a specified number.

.. rubric:: \* ``numbers`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <proving_inequalities>`; with ``at`` for contradictions: :numref:`Section %s <contradiction_hyp>`)

Proves numeric facts, like :math:`3\cdot 12 < 13 + 25` or :math:`3\cdot 5+1=4\cdot 4`.

.. rubric:: ``obtain`` (first use for :math:`\lor`: :numref:`Section %s <or>`; for :math:`\land`: :numref:`Section %s <and>`; for :math:`\exists`: :numref:`Section %s <exists>`)

Takes apart a hypothesis of the form "or" (:math:`\lor`), "and" (:math:`\land`) or "there exists"
(:math:`\exists`).

.. rubric:: ``push_neg`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <negation_normalize>`)

Converts a hypothesis or goal to a logically equivalent form with negations pushed inwards as far
as possible.

.. rubric:: ``rel`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <proving_inequalities>`; for congruences: :numref:`Section %s <using_modular>`; for logical equivalences: :numref:`Section %s <negation_normalize>`)

A "substitution-like" tactic for inequalities, or other relations such as congruences: looks for
the left-hand side of a specified inequality (or congruence, ...) fact in the goal, and replaces it
with the right-hand side of that fact, if that replacement is "obviously" a valid inequality
(or modular arithmetic, ...) deduction.  Compare with ``rw``.

.. rubric:: ``right`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <or>`)

Selects the right alternative of an "or" goal (:math:`\lor`).

.. rubric:: ``ring`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <proving_equalities_in_lean>`)

Solves algebraic equality goals such as :math:`(x + y) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + 2xy + y ^ 2`, when the proof
is effectively "expand out both sides and rearrange".

.. rubric:: ``rw`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <proving_equalities_in_lean>`; for ``↔`` hypotheses/lemmas: :numref:`Section %s <iff>`)

Substitution: looks for the left-hand side of a specified equality fact in the goal, and replaces it with
the right-hand side of that fact.

With ``↔`` hypotheses/lemmas, replaces the left-hand side of the specified ``↔`` fact with
the right-hand side of that fact.

.. rubric:: ``use`` (first use: :numref:`Section %s <exists>`)

Provides a witness to an existential goal (:math:`\exists`).
