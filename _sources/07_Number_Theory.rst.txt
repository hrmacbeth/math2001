Number theory
=============

This chapter is different in style from the other chapters of the book.  The facts here are
famous theorems, and their proofs require one-off, clever ideas.  These particular ideas will not
turn up again on homework or exams.  Think of this chapter instead as a capstone: we explore what
kinds of mathematical statements are in reach with the reasoning tools and theory we have developed
so far in the book.
