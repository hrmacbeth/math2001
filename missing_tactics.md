    - for `cases` 8.1.9
    - not sure if this is a tactic or other sort of syntax
- by
    - first use 1.2.1
    -  technically a keyword for entering a mode
- calc
    - first use 1.2.1
    - technically a keyword for entering a mode
- cases
    - first use 8.1.9
- choose
    - first (and only) use 8.3.7
    - probably not necessary in index since used only in one special case
- conv
    - first use 5.2.1
    - additional uses 5.2.2, 5.2.4, 9.3.4
    - probably not worth adding to index
- exhaust
    - first use (finite inductive types) 8.1.8
    - for equality proofs by set extensionality 9.2.2
    - paired with suffices 9.2.6
- ext:
    - first use (function extensionality) 8.3.2
    - syntax with product types 8.4.2
    - with set extensionality 9.1.5
        - special case syntax, `ext` without an argument for proof by contradiction 9.1.6

- norm_cast
    - first use 6.5.3
    - appears necessary to prove exercise 8 in Section 6.3, so you may want to either introduce and explain this tactic in that section, or alter the setup for that exercise to not require `norm_cast` (perhaps making `F` be type `ℕ → ℚ`?).  Or there is a way to do the proof without `norm_cast` which I was unable to figure out!
